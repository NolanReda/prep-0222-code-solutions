      Darth Bane is my favorite character because he is immensly powerful
        and alone was able to wipe out the power of the Dark Brotherhood
        that had corrupted the way of the Sith and in doing so, created the
        Rule of Two which states that there are only ever two Sith at a time,
        a master and an apprentice, one to embody power, and another
        to crave it.
